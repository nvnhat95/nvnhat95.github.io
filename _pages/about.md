Hello. This is Nguyễn Việt Nhật. These three words in my full name are family name, middle name, and first name respectively. Because of the middle name and name order confusion in many countries, you will find me writing my first name as Viet Nhat.
I normally introduce my name as Viet to foreigners for the ease of pronunciation.

I graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Trento, Italy. 
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in my country, Vietnam. 
Between the time from bachelor's graduation to master's starting, I worked as a data scientist in a Vietnamese company where I took part in processing videos and photos users upload into a social network platform.
During my master's studies I did internships at some research institutes, mostly focusing on Deep Learning for NLP and speech processing.
After master's graduation I was a contractor remotely working for MICrONS program as a Machine Learning engineer on the topic of utilizing neural data to improve machine learning robustness.

My research mainly centralizes on Deep Learning. Some topics of interest to me are interpretability, adversarial Machine Learning. I’m also interested in AI more broadly.
Recently I also found quantitative trading fascinating. I am building my own crypto trading bot and learning more about finance and investing. Ping me if you want to do an exchange of ideas or collaborate ;)

I like to write code craking things automatically. When I don't sit in front of computer, you may see me gardening, reading books, practicing ping-pong, or roaming around like an idiot.
