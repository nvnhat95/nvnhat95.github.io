Hello. This is *Nguyễn Việt Nhật*. These three words in my full name are family name, middle name, and first name respectively. Because of the middle name and name order confusion in many countries, you will find me writing my first name as *Viet Nhat* in formal documentation.
I normally introduce my name shortly as *Viet* to foreigners for the ease of pronunciation.

I graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Trento](https://www.disi.unitn.it/), Italy. 
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree at [HCMC University of Science](https://hcmus.edu.vn/) in my country, Vietnam. 
Between the time from bachelor's graduation to master's starting, I worked as a data scientist in a [Vietnamese company](https://zalo.ai/) where I took part in processing videos and photos users upload into a social network platform.
During my master's studies I did internships at some research institutes ([FBK](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/hlt-mt/join-us/) and [Inria](https://team.inria.fr/perception/alumni/viet-nhat-nguyen/)), mostly focusing on Deep Learning for NLP and speech processing.
After master's graduation I was a contractor remotely working for [MICrONS program](http://www.ninai.org/) as a Machine Learning engineer on the topic of utilizing neural data to improve machine learning robustness.

I like to write code cracking things automatically. When I don't sit in front of computer, you might see me either gardening, reading books, enjoying musics, practicing ping-pong, or simply roaming around.
